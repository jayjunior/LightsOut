# LightsOut

Here is just a simple GUI I made to a modified Version of the [LightOut Game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)>) .

### Description

---

-   In contrary to the Original Game Version , in this one they could be Occassionaly have some grey out lights that cannot be interacted with .

-   The other Lights stay as functional as usual and the objective of the game stays same ... **Switch all the lights off in a few switches as possible**

-   On a Technical side of things I also implemented an auto solver for any random game that could be generated .
    The solver was designed with a backtracking algorithm .
